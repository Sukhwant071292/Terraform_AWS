# Terraform_AWS
I successfully designed and implemented an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform, showcasing my expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud automation. This project enabled the creation of a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, including subnets, route tables, and security groups. By deploying an Apache web server on EC2 instances within the VPC, I enhanced web application hosting capabilities. Through the use of Terraform modules and AWS provider, I ensured efficiency and maintainability while significantly reducing deployment time and minimizing human error. This project exemplifies my proficiency in cloud architecture, automation, and best practices.
